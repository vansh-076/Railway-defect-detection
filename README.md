# Railway Defect Detection

## Description
The Railway Defect Detection project aims to utilize advanced machine learning techniques to identify and classify defects in railway infrastructure. By analyzing video feeds and sensor data, the project aims to improve the safety and efficiency of railway operations.

## Installation
To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vansh-076/Railway-defect-detection.git
    cd Railway-defect-detection
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
To run the railway defect detection system, execute the following command:
```bash
python main.py --input <path_to_input_data> --output <path_to_output_results>
```
Make sure to replace `<path_to_input_data>` and `<path_to_output_results>` with actual paths.

## Features
- Real-time defect detection
- Multi-class classification of defects
- User-friendly interface for input and output management
- Comprehensive logging for tracking and debugging
